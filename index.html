    <h2>What does “okiyu” mean?</h2>
    <p>The term <strong>okiyu</strong> is derived from the Japanese <em>ukiyo</em>, which can be translated as <em>flowing worlds</em>.</p>
    <p>With its origins in the progressive economic development of Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries, the term is symptomatic of a new economic order with numerous challenges.</p>
    <p>Characteristic of this period was the constant need for new knowledge and skills in order to exploit the resulting potential.</p>
