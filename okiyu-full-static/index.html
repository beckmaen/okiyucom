      <h2>Meaning</h2>
      <p>The term <em>okiyu</em> is derived from the Japanese <em>ukiyo</em>, which can be translated as flowing worlds. With its origins in the progressive economic development of Japan during the 18th and 19th centuries, the term is symptomatic of a new economic order with numerous challenges.</p>
      <p>Characteristic of this period was the constant need for new knowledge and skills in order to exploit the resulting potential.</p>
